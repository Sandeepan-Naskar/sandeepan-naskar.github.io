                    I've been passionate about chess for as long as I can remember, and it became a serious pursuit during my third year. If you're up for a game, you can check out my profiles on <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/bajrangdal69" target="_blank">chess.com</a> and <a href="https://lichess.org/@/Bajrangdal" target="_blank">lichess.org</a>. My peak rating is around <span class="purple">1410</span> across Bullet, Blitz, and Rapid on lichess. I also frequently participate in Swiss tournaments on lichess. Below is a highlight of one of my higher-rated wins where I executed a queen sacrifice.

    I often find myself picking up a pen or pencil and sketching whatever catches my eyeâ€”whether it's a friend's face, the room around me, or random ideas that pop into my head. While I wouldn't call myself a professional artist, sketching is something I genuinely enjoy. Below are a few of my sketches.
